**Aim**

The creation of machine/deep learning models and automation retraining operations systems and pipelines

**Goals include**

• Design, develop, and research Machine Learning systems, models, tools, and schemes

• Study, transform, and convert data science prototypes

• Determine appropriate data sets before performing data collection and data modelling

• Perform statistical analysis and use results to improve models

• Train and retrain ML/DL systems and models as required

• Identify differences in data distributions that could affect model performance in real-world situations

• Visualize data for deeper insights

• Analyze the use cases of ML algorithms and rank them by their success probability

• Apply insights to business decisions

• Enrich existing ML/DL frameworks and libraries

• Verify data quality

• Optimize model deployment
