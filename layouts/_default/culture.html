                    Knowledge sharing, innovation and product development are a matter of course for us. 
                    We also like to share our knowledge with others, for which we regularly organize meetups and workshops. 
                    To be inspired, we visit worldwide conferences (London, Moscow). 
                    We are also speakers or give presentations at various conferences such as ODSC, Devoxx, Teqnation and JFall.
